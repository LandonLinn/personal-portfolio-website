# 🚀 Personal Portfolio Website

## Overview
A full-stack portfolio application built with React, Express, MongoDB, and AWS to showcase projects, UX work, freelance experience, and technical skills in a scalable, real-world environment.

This project was created to demonstrate production-level development skills beyond coursework, including API design, database modeling, responsive UI, and deployment.

---

## Problem Statement
Traditional portfolios often show static work but don’t demonstrate real full-stack capability.  
This project solves that by providing a dynamic platform to manage projects, blog posts, and content through a backend-connected system.

---

## Goals
- Build a production-ready full-stack portfolio outside of coursework  
- Demonstrate applied skills in React, Node.js, MongoDB, and AWS  
- Create a scalable platform to showcase projects
- Practice real deployment, environment configuration, and database design
